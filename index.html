          <p>
            Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an
            English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst,
            philosopher and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential
            in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a
            formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the
            Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose
            computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of
            theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite
            these accomplishments, he was never fully recognized in his home
            country during his lifetime due to his homosexuality, which was then
            a crime in the UK.

          <p>
            During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code
            and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking
            centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8,
            the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis.
            Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of
            German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe
            method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for
            the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking
            intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the
            Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the
            Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war. Counterfactual history
            is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on
            the length of the war, but at the upper end it has been estimated
            that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years
            and saved over 14 million lives.

              The day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to
              Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS. Specifying the bombe
              was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing
              made during the war.
